Tools to adjust monitor and keyboard brightness on Macbook air:

  brightness --set <percentage>
    - sets brightness to specified percentage

  brightness --increment
    - increments current brightness by 10% (should take ten calls to go from
      empty to full)

  brightness --decrement
    - decrements current brightness by 10% (should take ten calls to go from
      full to empty)

Two tools:
  keyboardLight: controls the keyboard backlight intensity
    cc keyboardLight.c brightnessLib.c -o keyboardLight

  displayLight: controls the monitor intensity
    cc displayLight.c brightnessLib.c -o displayLight
